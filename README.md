# Image_Manipulator (WIP)

 Image Manipulation software. I will write a more detailed description one day. 
 You may look at the gifs and pngs to see the results. beans.png and rainbow.png are the samples I am using as input.

## For this to run properly you will need to:
 - be on Linux
 - have NETPBM installed
 - have GIFSICLE installed (for GIF related operations)
